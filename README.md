Project Description:

This is a fully functional Swiggy Clone built using React.js and modern frontend tools that simulates the core user experience of the Swiggy food delivery platform. It fetches live restaurant data from Swiggy's API and provides users with a seamless food ordering interface. The application incorporates modern React features like React Router, Redux for global state management, and Parcel as the build tool for fast bundling and hot reloading.
